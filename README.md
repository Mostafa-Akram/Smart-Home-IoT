Certainly! Here's the revised order:

1. Set up the Development Environment:
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine.
   - Install MongoDB and ensure it is running.

2. Create a New Project:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the desired directory.
   - Run the following command to create a new MERN project:

     ```
     npx create-react-app smart-home
     ```

3. Frontend Setup:
   - Navigate to the project directory:

     ```
     cd smart-home
     ```

   - Install the required dependencies:

     ```
     npm install axios react-router-dom
     ```

   - Update the `src/App.js` file with your desired React components and routes.

4. Run the Project:
   - In one terminal, navigate to the project root directory and start the React development server:

     ```
     npm start
     ```

     ``
     download the background video from the link below then add it in public folder
     ``
[`pexels.com/video/smart-home-button-25951436/`](https://pexels.com/video/smart-home-button-25951436/)

        ``then rename the video to "BGvid2.mp4" and start``

5. Backend Setup (server.js):
   - Create a new directory called `server`:

     ```
     mkdir server
     ```

   - Inside the `server` directory, create a new file called `server.js` which will contain the backend code.
   - Install the required dependencies:

     ```
     cd server
     npm init -y
     npm install express mongoose cors
     ```

   - Create a new file `server.js` and add the following code:

     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const mongoose = require('mongoose');
     const cors = require('cors');

     const app = express();
     const port = 5000;

     // Middleware
     app.use(cors());
     app.use(express.json());

     // Routes
     // Add your API routes here

     // Connect to MongoDB
     mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/smart-home', {
       useNewUrlParser: true,
       useUnifiedTopology: true,
     });
     const connection = mongoose.connection;
     connection.once('open', () => {
       console.log('Connected to MongoDB database');
     });

     // Start the server
     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on port: ${port}`);
     });
     ```

6. GPIO Control:
   - Install the required libraries to control GPIO pins on your embedded Linux device.
   - Implement GPIO control logic within your `server.js` file based on the GPIO library you choose to use.

7. Access the Smart Home Website:
   - Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the smart home website.
   - You can now control your home devices through the website, which communicates with the backend server and interacts with the GPIO drivers on your embedded Linux device.

Remember to adapt the code to fit your specific requirements, including GPIO library usage, device control logic, and additional functionality as needed.
